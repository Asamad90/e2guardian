Revised Phaselists

These updated phrase lists are held in language directorys.

Protex has updated the ukenglish lists and this is a snapshot of the work 
doen by Protex staff on these lists.  The updated lists give a much reduced 
rate of false positives than the old phrases lists.

Languages other than English - I have populated these with what information I 
have, but a number of languages have very sparse lists, and urgently need 
revison by native speakers.

If you have better lists then please contribute them so that the lists 
can be more complete.

In v5.3. both the old and new phrase lists are in the distribution and the
sample list files point at the old phraselists.   To use the new lists 
you will need to amend the master phraselists manually to point at the 
new path.

Whan v5.4 is released the new phraselist will be the default.
